Zepto Web Server -- `BUILD' starts here.

Build:

  If you want to build the program you must first use a shell.

  Next, be sure that your current working directory is the `src' directory.

  You can perform this by using the `pwd' and `cd' commands.

  Now, to build the program you have to run:

    `make'

  However, if you want to support locales you must run it as follows:

    `make locales_path="$LOCALES_PATH"'

  The variable `LOCALES_PATH' has to be set to the path of the locales directory.

  Happy Hacking!

Zepto Web Server -- `BUILD' ends here.
